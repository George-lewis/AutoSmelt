# Autosmelt

Adds a new enchantment to Minecraft called "Smelting". The enchantment applies to tools and smelts block drops.

### Details

- The enchantment is just as rare as Silk Touch, and requires similar amounts of exp
- The enchantment is mutually exclusive with Silk Touch (one tool can't have both!)
- A tool with the enchantment will only smelt drops for blocks the tool is meant for
  - e.g. a pickaxe with Smelting won't smelt a mined block of sand
